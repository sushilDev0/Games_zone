\section{Introduction}
This project presents a responsive and dynamic version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed using React.js. The application allows two players to engage in turn-based gameplay and supports customizable board sizes ranging from 3x3 to 10x10, enhancing the traditional game’s flexibility. The primary objective was to deepen understanding of React concepts, including component-based architecture, state management with hooks (\texttt{useState}, \texttt{useEffect}), props, conditional rendering, and CSS styling.

\section{Features}
The Tic Tac Toe game includes the following features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Board Size}: Supports boards from 3x3 to 10x10.
    \item \textbf{Alternating Player Turns}: Players alternate between `X' and `O'.
    \item \textbf{Automatic Win Detection}: Detects winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals.
    \item \textbf{Draw Detection}: Identifies when the game ends in a draw.
    \item \textbf{Game Reset Button}: Allows restarting the game.
    \item \textbf{Responsive UI}: Styled using CSS and inline styles for a polished look.
\end{itemize}

\section{Component Architecture}
The application is structured into modular components for maintainability and scalability:
\begin{description}
    \item[App.jsx] Root component responsible for rendering the game and title.
    \item[Game.jsx] Manages core logic, game state, win conditions, and dynamic board resizing.
    \item[Board.jsx] Receives board data and renders the grid layout using CSS Grid.
    \item[Square.jsx] Represents individual cells, styled as buttons with hover and active effects.
\end{description}

\section{Technologies Used}
The project leverages the following technologies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{React.js}: For building the user interface.
    \item \textbf{JavaScript (ES6+)}: For game logic and interactivity.
    \item \textbf{CSS}: For styling and responsive layout.
    \item \textbf{Vite (or React CLI)}: For project setup and build processes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Screenshots}
The following screenshots illustrate the game’s interface:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Figure 1}: 3x3 Board with a Win (\texttt{./img/snip.png}).
    \item \textbf{Figure 2}: 5x5 Board (\texttt{./img/snip.png}).
    \item \textbf{Figure 3}: 4x4 Board (\texttt{./img/snip3.png}).
\end{itemize}
To view these images, open them from the \texttt{img/} folder.

\section{Learnings}
Through this project, the following skills were developed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lifting and managing shared state in React.
    \item Efficient board rendering using array mapping.
    \item Implementing win and draw condition detection logic.
    \item Utilizing CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design.
    \item Structuring components for reusability and maintainability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges Faced}
The development process presented several challenges, showcasing problem-solving skills:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Win Conditions for Larger Grids}: Adapting logic to handle dynamic board sizes.
    \item \textbf{Preventing Unnecessary Re-renders}: Optimizing React component updates.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Board Creation}: Managing user input for variable board sizes.
    \item \textbf{Scalable Logic}: Ensuring clean and maintainable code for boards from 3x3 to 10x10.
\end{itemize}

\section{Improvements and Next Steps}
Future enhancements to the project include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single-Player Mode}: Implementing an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.
    \item \textbf{Theme Customizer}: Adding light and dark mode options.
    \item \textbf{Animations}: Enhancing cell updates with smooth transitions.
    \item \textbf{Keyboard Navigation}: Supporting gameplay via keyboard inputs.
    \item \textbf{Move History and Undo}: Allowing players to review and revert moves.
\end{itemize}
